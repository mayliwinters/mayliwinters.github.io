  <p class="description">Hi, I'm Mayli Winters, a current Computer Science student at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities College of Science and Engineering, working towards a minor in Mathematics.
    I am interested in utilizing my programming skills in languages such as Java, Python, and C to develop solutions to everyday issues. My current focus is on exploring the connection between computer science and healthcare to improve patient care and medical technology. This website was coded by me and me only so I encourage you to explore it!</p>
